# BaseBlitz
a tile based 4e game

Maps are loaded from json files generated by the Tiled map editor. Layer names are important. Anything on the layer named 'blockedLayer' will act as solid in the collider physics. Objects should be placed on 'objectsLayer' and are loaded dynamically. Players can either be loaded from the map or created in Game.js. In Tiled, give objects a custom propery with a name of 'type' and its type value the object name to search for. The 'findObjectsByType' function will search for that name and create an array of all matching objects.
